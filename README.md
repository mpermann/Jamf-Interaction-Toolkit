# What is the Jamf Interaction Toolkit?

![](./images/macos-mojave-preview.png) 

Jamf Interaction Toolkit, commonly known as UEX, was built with a few goals in mind:

* Setup software deployments that are:
  * Branded and trusted
  * Consistent across the enterprise 
  * Notify the user when apps need to be quit or to not be opened
  * Notify the user when the computer needs to be restarted
  * Allow the user to postpone the action based on number of times instead of an end date
* All of this has to be compatible with Jamf Pro.
* All of this has to be work tandem with Self Service.

Over time this tool has grown into a full set of versatile scripts that can essentially be used as your primary method for creating policies. 

**OR**

You can just use it for your next **macOS Upgrade**.

# What can it do?

The UEX Toolkit supports all types of deployment needs:

* User needs to Quit an application[s] before a policy starts
  * Prevent those apps from opening during the policy
  * Re-open apps previously quit after the policy runs.
* Inform the user of a restart or logout before a policy starts
  * Require the computer to be connected to [power](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/09-Checks...-All-the-Options-for-UEX#power)
* Support running other policies after the user acknowledges a custom message [trigger](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/09-Checks...-All-the-Options-for-UEX#trigger)
* Support forceful running of [Compliance Policies](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/05-Compliance-Policies)
* [Detect if the user is in a presentation](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/99-Presentation-Delay)
* [FileVault authenticated restarts](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/07-FileVault-Authenticated-Restarts)
* [Apple Software Updates](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/04---Apple-Software-Updates-via-UEX)
* [Detection of insufficient space and workflows to create tickets](https://github.com/cubandave/Jamf-Interaction-Toolkit/wiki/06-Space-Detection-Notification-Service-Desk-Tickets)
